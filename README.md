# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of steganography to securely hide sensitive information within images. The technique provides a subtle method for data protection, ensuring confidentiality and security during transmission.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV (cv2):** For reading and writing images.
- **OS (os):** To interact with the operating system.
- **Dictionaries:** For encoding and decoding secret messages.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main script that embeds and extracts hidden messages in images.
- `Tom&Jerry.jpg`: Sample image used for the demonstration.
- `encryptedImage.jpg`: Output image with the hidden message.
